# DEIS on Kubernetes (k8s) on Azure Container Service Hands on Lab


## Why I created this HoL ?
On April 10, [Microsoft to acquire Deis](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2017/04/10/microsoft-acquire-deis-help-companies-innovate-containers/ "Microsoft to acquire Deis") to help companies innovate with containers. And I explained 12 Factor App to Japanese developers. At that time, I evaluated DEIS on k8s on ACS. So I will share my evaluation prosess as follows.

[Original My Evaluation script is this link](https://github.com/yoshioterada/PayaraMicro-MicroServices-for-Azure/blob/master/DEIS-K8S-ACS-Azure.txt). And in order to understand more easily, now I recreating this from the above like to follows.  

**Note : Not yet finished to write all things. If you would like to try more than follows, please see the above original document?**
