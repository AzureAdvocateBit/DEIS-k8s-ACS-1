# Create Kubernetes on Azure Container Services (ACS) 

## Preparation to access to the ACS

In order to create the ACS on Azure, you need to get Principan information by using Azure CLI v2 (az command) on your local environment. 

## Install Azure CLI 2.0 

In order to install the Azure CLI 2.0, please refer to the 
"[Install Azure CLI 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)" documents?

If you are using Linux or Mac, simply please execute following command to install the cli on your machine?

```
$ curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCli | bash
```

**Note for Linux or Mac Users :**  
If you are using "Anaconda" on your system, you may fail to install the Azure CLI 2.0. If you uninstall it, you may be able to install the Azure CLI 2.0.

**Note for Mac Users :**  
If you execute the above "curl" and faced "openssl file not found" error, you may need to execute "xcode-select --install" command.

```
$ curl -L https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCli | bash
...

    cc -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-common -dynamic -arch x86_64 -arch i386 -g -Os -pipe -fno-common -fno-strict-aliasing -fwrapv -DENABLE_DTRACE -DMACOSX -DNDEBUG -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wshorten-64-to-32 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -Os -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -DENABLE_DTRACE -arch x86_64 -arch i386 -pipe -I/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/include/python2.7 -c build/temp.macosx-10.12-intel-2.7/_openssl.c -o build/temp.macosx-10.12-intel-2.7/build/temp.macosx-10.12-intel-2.7/_openssl.o

    error: command 'cc' failed with exit status 1
...    
    
$ xcode-select --install
```

## Login Azure from Azure CLI 2.0 

In order to login to the Azure via the CLI, please execute **"az login"** command ? Then you see the following message.  

```
$ az login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page 
https://aka.ms/devicelogin 
and enter the code GG9XHVJRB to authenticate.
```

In order to login, please open the browser and access to the above URL? Then you can see the following screen.

After finished the above, please go back to the command prompt? Then you can see the following messages.  


```
$ az login
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the code GG9XHVJRB to authenticate.
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "acc75193-****-****-****-401e1a2bde7e",

```

In this result, only one subscription was showed. However you can use many subscription for one user. So please set for the account the specific subscription as follows.  

```
$ az account set --subscription â€œacc75193-****-****-****-401e1a2bde7e"
```

After set the subscription, please create **"Service Principal"** and **"Client Secret"** for K8S? This information will be used during the creation of Azure Container Services on Azure Portal Screen. Please execut **az ad sp create-for-rbac** command?  

```
$ az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/acc75193-eb5a-48e1-b9a7-401e1a2bde7e"

  "tenant": "387983da-****-****-****-61869f94518d"
}
```

After executed the above command, **please remember the value of "appId (Service Principal ID)" and "password (Client Secret)"**?  


## Create SSH Keys for login

Please create ssh key file to login to the Azure ACS? In your local environment, please execute ssh-keygen and create key file as follows.  

Create key as yosshi-k8s-acs :  

```
$ ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/tyoshio2002/.ssh/id_rsa): yosshi-k8s-acs
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in yosshi-k8s-acs.
Your public key has been saved in yosshi-k8s-acs.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:jN4a+q1h9cspxZMA+vIEUTE0YH9yAga6xLO721ylMgI yoterada@Yoshio-no-MacBook-Pro.local
The key's randomart image is:
